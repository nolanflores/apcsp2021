# apcsp2021

This was a Protfolio webpage I made sophmore year of highschool.
It was an assignment for AP Computer Science Principles.
This Repository was my first experience with github and html.

You can view the website in the github deployments.
I can not assure everything will still work, I had used quite a few html embeds.
